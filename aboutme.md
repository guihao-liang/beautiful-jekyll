I'm working for Apple as a **software engineer** to build infrastructure for machine learning products. One project that I can tell the public is [TuriCreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate). Previously, I worked for Zillow Group to develop the core in-house built search engine, called POGO, under Chief Architect [Randy Puttick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-puttick-b00aa0/)'s supervision.

During spare time, I love playing basketball, reading, writing and sketching. I tried to learn Saxophone, but ended up being too noisy to my neighbors and stoped in the halfway. If I had a big house, I would reume it.
